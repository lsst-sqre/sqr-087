# Structured information service: preliminary notes

```{abstract}
Preliminary design notes for an information architecture for publishing source-of-truth documentation snippets, metadata and other structured "factoids" via an API for consumption, inter alia, by a Datalink service. This document is to support largely internal discussions in the Data Services teams. 

Everything, including package names, is subject to change.
